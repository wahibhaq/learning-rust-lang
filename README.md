# Learning Rust Language 
World's most loved programming language of 2015 & 2016 as per [Stack Overflow Dev Survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)

I created this repo just to share and document what I will read, learn and practice.


# Resources

## Components

  * [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) : The Rust package manager. Something like we have Gradle for Java.
  * [Crates.io](https://crates.io) : Rust community's central repository that serves as a location to discover and download packages. Something like we have maven for Java.


## Talks

  * [Rust: Unlocking Systems Programming](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/rust-thread-safety) : [Aaron Turon](https://twitter.com/aaron_turon) explains Rust's core notion of “ownership” and shows how Rust uses it to guarantee thread safety, amongst other things.
